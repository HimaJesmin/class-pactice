		<p>Animal cruelty has no boundaries, whether through neglect or intentional acts of violence against animals. Statistically, regions of the United States facing economic and educational challenges tend to foster neglect and intentional cruel treatment of animals. This is where our Justice for Animals campaign rises to the challenge, to promote an environment in which just laws are enacted and enforced. We are forging strong coalitions in the Deep South that incorporate law enforcement, judges, prosecuting attorneys, humane representatives, and citizens to impact county and municipal ordinances and state statutes on a grass roots level that comes from the heart of Mississippians. We work with law enforcement to share knowledge of animal law, provide guidance in investigating cruelty complaints, establish resources to address cruelty cases, and empower future generation of caring individuals as to how humans and other animals can coexist harmoniously to benefit all.</p>
